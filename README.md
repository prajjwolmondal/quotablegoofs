# quotablegoofs

This is a Go webserver that will server as a backend from a couple of mobile apps that I'm developing.

Currently these are the goals of this project:
1. Provide jokes
    - One-line jokes
    - Multi-line jokes
    - Knock knock jokes
2. Provide quotes
3. Provide end-users a way to upvote/downvote the jokes & quotes so that unpopular ones aren't shown as frequently
